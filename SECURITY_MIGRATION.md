# Security Migration Report

## Excel Library Migration (xlsx → exceljs)

### Security Vulnerabilities Eliminated

This migration successfully eliminated the following high-severity security vulnerabilities from the xlsx library:

1. **Prototype Pollution** (GHSA-4r6h-8v6p-xvw6) - HIGH severity
   - Fixed by removing xlsx dependency entirely
   - Replaced with secure exceljs library

2. **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)** (GHSA-5pgg-2g8v-p4x9) - HIGH severity  
   - Fixed by removing xlsx dependency entirely
   - Replaced with secure exceljs library

### Token Storage Security Enhancement

Migrated Mapbox token storage from insecure localStorage to secure IndexedDB:

- **Before**: Tokens stored in localStorage (accessible to all scripts)
- **After**: Tokens stored in IndexedDB with validation and automatic migration
- **Validation**: Only valid Mapbox tokens (pk.* format) are accepted
- **Migration**: Automatic one-time migration from localStorage to IndexedDB

### Technical Changes

#### New Files Added
- `src/lib/excelAdapter.ts` - Secure Excel file handling using exceljs
- `src/security/storage.ts` - Secure token storage with IndexedDB
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - CI pipeline using pnpm

#### Files Modified
- `package.json` - Removed xlsx, added pnpm configuration
- `src/hooks/useExcelUpload.tsx` - Now uses secure excelAdapter
- `src/hooks/useExcelExport.tsx` - Migrated to ExcelJS
- `src/utils/excelFormatter.ts` - Updated to use ExcelJS
- `src/templates/ExcelTemplate.ts` - Deprecated in favor of ExcelJS version
- `src/components/location/LocationMap.tsx` - Uses secure token storage

#### Package Management
- Switched from npm to pnpm for deterministic builds
- Node.js version requirement: >= 20
- Reduced build size and improved security posture

### Verification

```bash
# No more high-severity vulnerabilities
pnpm audit --audit-level=high
# Shows: "1 vulnerabilities found, Severity: 1 moderate" (not xlsx-related)

# No XLSX imports remain
grep -r "import.*XLSX\|from.*xlsx" src/
# Returns: no results

# Build successful
pnpm run build
# ✅ Built successfully
```

### Impact

- **Security**: Eliminated 2 high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Performance**: Maintained equivalent functionality with better security
- **Maintainability**: Cleaner codebase with modern package management
- **User Experience**: No breaking changes, automatic token migration

### Future Considerations

The migration provides a solid foundation for:
1. Adding Content Security Policy (CSP) headers
2. Further security hardening
3. Modern web security best practices

This migration successfully addresses the security concerns identified in the original assessment.

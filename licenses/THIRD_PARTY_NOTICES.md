A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE ========================== Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands as a successor of a language called ABC. Guido remains Python's principal author, although it includes many contributions from others. In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us) in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the software. In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team. In October of the same year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became Zope Corporation. In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property. Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF. All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for the Open Source Definition). Historically, most, but not all, Python releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes the various releases. Release Derived Year Owner GPL- from compatible? (1) 0.9.0 thru 1.2 1991-1995 CWI yes 1.3 thru 1.5.2 1.2 1995-1999 CNRI yes 1.6 1.5.2 2000 CNRI no 2.0

binary ====== Unpack multibyte binary values from buffers and streams. You can specify the endianness and signedness of the fields to be unpacked too. This module is a cleaner and more complete version of [bufferlist](https://github.com/substack/node-bufferlist)'s binary module that runs on pre-allocated buffers instead of a linked list. [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary.png)](http://travis-ci.org/substack/node-binary) examples ======== stream.js --------- ``` js var binary = require('binary'); var ws = binary() .word32lu('x') .word16bs('y') .word16bu('z') .tap(function (vars) { console.dir(vars); }) ; process.stdin.pipe(ws); process.stdin.resume(); ``` output: ``` $ node examples/stream.js abcdefgh { x: 1684234849, y: 25958, z: 26472 } ^D ``` parse.js -------- ``` js var buf = new Buffer([ 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 0 ]); var binary = require('binary'); var vars = binary.parse(buf) .word16ls('ab') .word32bu('cf') .word8('x') .vars ; console.dir(vars); ``` output: ``` { ab: 25185, cf: 1667523942, x: 0 } ``` methods ======= `var binary = require('binary')` var b = binary() ---------------- Return a new writable stream `b` that has the chainable methods documented below for buffering binary input. binary.parse(buf) ----------------- Parse a static buffer in one pass. Returns a chainable interface with the methods below plus a `vars` field to get at the variable stash as the last item in a chain. In parse mode, methods

bytewise ======== Binary serialization of arbitrarily complex structures that sort element-wise [![build status](https://travis-ci.org/deanlandolt/bytewise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deanlandolt/bytewise) Allows efficient comparison of a variety of useful data structures in a way that respects the sort order defined by [typewise](https://github.com/deanlandolt/typewise). The [bytewise-core](https://github.com/deanlandolt/bytewise-core) library defines a total order for well-structured keyspaces in key value stores. The ordering is a superset of the sorting algorithm defined by [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#key-construct) and the one defined by [CouchDB](http://wiki.apache.org/couchdb/View_collation). This serialization makes it easy to take advantage of the benefits of structured indexing in systems with fast but naïve binary indexing (key/value databases). ## Order of Supported Structures This is the top level order of the various structures that may be encoded: * `null` * `false` * `true` * `Number` (numeric) * `Date` (numeric, epoch offset) * `Buffer` (bitwise) * `String` (lexicographic) * `Array` (componentwise) * `undefined` These specific structures can be used to serialize the vast majority of javascript values in a way that can be sorted in an efficient, complete and sensible manner. Each value is prefixed with a type tag, and we do some bit munging to encode our values in such a way as to carefully preserve the desired sort behavior, even in the presence of structural nested.

Chainsaw ======== Build chainable fluent interfaces the easy way in node.js. With this meta-module you can write modules with chainable interfaces. Chainsaw takes care of all of the boring details and makes nested flow control super simple too. Just call `Chainsaw` with a constructor function like in the examples below. In your methods, just do `saw.next()` to move along to the next event and `saw.nest()` to create a nested chain. Examples ======== add_do.js --------- This silly example adds values with a chainsaw. var Chainsaw = require('chainsaw'); function AddDo (sum) { return Chainsaw(function (saw) { this.add = function (n) { sum += n; saw.next(); }; this.do = function (cb) { saw.nest(cb, sum); }; }); } AddDo(0) .add(5) .add(10) .do(function (sum) { if (sum > 12) this.add(-10); }) .do(function (sum) { console.log('Sum: ' + sum); }) ; Output: Sum: 5 prompt.js --------- This example provides a wrapper on top of stdin with the help of [node-lazy](https://github.com/pkrumins/node-lazy) for line-processing. var Chainsaw = require('chainsaw'); var Lazy = require('lazy'); module.exports = Prompt; function Prompt (stream) { var waiting = []; var lines = []; var lazy = Lazy(stream).lines.map(String) .forEach(function (line) { if (waiting.length) { var w = waiting.shift(); w(line); } else lines.push(line); }) ; var

Smallest possible implementation: only **130 bytes.** You could write this yourself, but then you'd have to write [tests]. Supports ES Modules, CommonJS and globals. ### Installation `npm install --save dlv` ### Usage `delve(object, keypath, [default])` ```js import delve from 'dlv'; let obj = { a: { b: { c: 1, d: undefined, e: null } } }; //use string dot notation for keys delve(obj, 'a.b.c') === 1; //or use an array key delve(obj, ['a', 'b', 'c']) === 1; delve(obj, 'a.b') === obj.a.b; //returns undefined if the full key path does not exist and no default is specified delve(obj, 'a.b.f') === undefined; //optional third parameter for default if the full key in path is missing delve(obj, 'a.b.f', 'foo') === 'foo'; //or if the key exists but the value is undefined delve(obj, 'a.b.d', 'foo') === 'foo'; //Non-truthy defined values are still returned if they exist at the full keypath delve(obj, 'a.b.e', 'foo') === null; //undefined obj or key returns undefined, unless a default is supplied delve(undefined,

# html-parse-stringify This is an _experimental lightweight approach_ to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string. As it turns out, if you can make a the simplifying assumptions about HTML that all tags must be closed or self-closing. Which is OK for _this_ particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex. "Why on earth would you do this?! Haven't you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!" Why yes, yes I have :) But the truth is. If you _could_ do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing? Yes. React.js essentially pioneered the approach. With React you render to a "virtual DOM" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the _real_ DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible. As a result, when you're building a single page app, you don't have

# MurmurHash.js An optimized JavaScript implementation of the MurmurHash algorithms. These algorithms take a JavaScript string (and a seed), and quickly create a non-cryptographic 32-bit hash from it. And by quick I mean sub-millisecond performance. More information about these algorithms can be found at: * [MurmurHash Homepage](http://sites.google.com/site/murmurhash/) * [Wikipedia Entry on MurmurHash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MurmurHash) ## Install npm install murmurhash-js ## API ```javascript var murmur = require("murmurhash-js") ``` ### Methods #### `murmur.murmur2(key, seed)` Runs the murmur2 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`. #### `murmur.murmur3(key, seed)` Runs the murmur3 hash algorithm on the string `key` with initial seed `seed`. **Note** `require("murmur-hash")` is the same as `murmur.murmur3` ## License (MIT) Copyright (c) 2011 Gary Court Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

# prepin > An in-place pre-processor for javascript files using C style pre-compile syntax to compose custom builds from npm-packages. [![NPM version][badge]][repo] Pre-processors found on [npm][] require a different file for outputting processed changes. This is not ideal for in-place custom builds on already published packages. This pre-processors main purpose is to allow reduction of package size for e.g. single-page apps on not requiring modules based on macros given at transpile time. ## Syntax Follows C style pre-compiler syntax but requires `//` right in front to work in .js files. ``` // #if expression // e.g. // #if macro == 1 // #if defined(macro) // #ifdef macro // #ifndef macro // #elif expression // e.g. // #elif macro == 2 // #else // #endif // # is a commented line ``` ## Example Let's assume a `example/sample.js` file, which includes a package of large size which is required for a specific task is not used in a smaller custom build... The original file: ```js // #ifndef small const big = require('./big-package') // #else // # let big // define the alternative // #endif if (big) { // ... } ``` If processing with `prepin -m small sample.js` you'll get: ```js

<hr />

> v1+ for React 15, v2+ requires React 16.8+

Removes scroll bar (by setting `overflow: hidden` on body), and preserves the scroll bar "gap".

Read - it just makes scroll bar invisible.

Does nothing if scroll bar does not consume any space.

# Usage

```js
import {RemoveScrollBar} from 'react-remove-scroll-bar';

<RemoveScrollBar /> -> no scroll bar
```

### The Right Border
To prevent content jumps __position:fixed__ elements with `right:0`  should have additional classname applied.
It will just provide a _non-zero_ right, when it needed, to maintain the right "gap".
```js
import {zeroRightClassName,fullWidthClassName, noScrollbarsClassName} from 'react-remove-scroll-bar';

// to set `right:0` on an element
<div className={zeroRightClassName} />

// to set `width:100%` on an element
<div className={fullWidthClassName} />

// to remove scrollbar from an element
<div className={noScrollbarsClassName} />

```

# Size
500b after compression (excluding tslib).

# Scroll-Locky
All code is a result of a [react-scroll-locky](https://github.com/theKashey/react-scroll-locky) refactoring.

# Article
There is a medium article about preventing the body scroll - [How to fight the <body> scroll](https://medium.com/@antonkorzunov/how-to-fight-the-body-scroll-2b00267b37ac)

# saxes A sax-style non-validating parser for XML. Saxes is a fork of [sax](https://github.com/isaacs/sax-js) 1.2.4. All mentions of sax in this project's documentation are references to sax 1.2.4. Designed with [node](http://nodejs.org/) in mind, but should work fine in the browser or other CommonJS implementations. Saxes does not support Node versions older than 10. ## Notable Differences from Sax. * Saxes aims to be much stricter than sax with regards to XML well-formedness. Sax, even in its so-called "strict mode", is not strict. It silently accepts structures that are not well-formed XML. Projects that need better compliance with well-formedness constraints cannot use sax as-is. Consequently, saxes does not support HTML, or pseudo-XML, or bad XML. Saxes will report well-formedness errors in all these cases but it won't try to extract data from malformed documents like sax does. * Saxes is much much faster than sax, mostly because of a substantial redesign of the internal parsing logic. The speed improvement is not merely due to removing features that were supported by sax. That helped a bit, but saxes adds some expensive checks in its aim for conformance with the XML specification. Redesigning the parsing logic is what accounts for most of the

# typewise

Typewise structured sorting for arbirarily complex data structures.

[![build status](https://travis-ci.org/deanlandolt/typewise.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/deanlandolt/typewise)

This library defines and implements the collation used by the [bytewise](https://github.com/deanlandolt/bytewise-core) encoding library.

NOTE: the core typewise sorting functionality has been completely rewritten and moved to [typewise-core](https://github.com/deanlandolt/typewise-core). This library extends the data structures and comparators available to support more exotic types like ordered maps and sets, and shortlex-ordered tuples and records.


## Type system

In order to properly express the rules for sorting and equality for a wide range of structures `typewise` defines a simple type system for controlling these properties across a range of data structures.

A `typewise` type profile can be provide when creating a bytewise codec to control encoding and decoding behavior for specific types. Types may also contain high and low sentinal values that can be used to create `range` types which may be impossible be instantiate directly as instances.

For example, dates have no valid infinatary instances, but something analogous to the "minimum" and "maximum" dates is a useful construct for defining date intervals.


## Issues

Issues should be reported [here](https://github.com/deanlandolt/bytewise/issues).

# VictoryVendor Vendored dependencies for Victory. ## Background D3 has released most of its libraries as ESM-only. This means that consumers in Node.js applications can no longer just `require()` anything with a d3 transitive dependency, including much of Victory. To help provide an easy path to folks still using CommonJS in their Node.js applications that consume Victory, we now provide this package to vendor in various d3-related packages. ## Packages We presently provide the following top-level libraries: <!-- cat packages/victory-vendor/package.json | egrep '"d3-' | egrep -o 'd3-[^"]*'| sor t--> - d3-ease - d3-interpolate - d3-scale - d3-shape - d3-timer This is the total list of top and transitive libraries we vendor: <!-- ls packages/victory-vendor/lib-vendor | sort --> - d3-array - d3-color - d3-ease - d3-format - d3-interpolate - d3-path - d3-scale - d3-shape - d3-time - d3-time-format - d3-timer - internmap Note that this does _not_ include the following D3 libraries that still support CommonJS: - d3-voronoi ## How it works We provide two alternate paths and behaviors -- for ESM and CommonJS ### ESM If you do a Node.js import like: ```js import { interpolate } from "victory-vendor/d3-interpolate"; ``` under the hood it's going to just re-export and pass

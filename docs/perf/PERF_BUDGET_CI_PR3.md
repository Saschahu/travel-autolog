# Performance Budget & CI Guard Implementation (PR3)

**Timestamp**: 2025-09-19T13:23:00Z

## Executive Summary

This implementation adds automated performance budget checks to the Travel AutoLog CI pipeline, preventing bundle size regressions without relying on external services. The system enforces initial JavaScript/CSS payload limits and fails builds when thresholds are exceeded.

**What is enforced and why:**
- **Initial Bundle Size**: The combined size of all entry chunks and their eager dependencies
- **Purpose**: Prevent performance degradation that impacts user experience, especially on slower connections
- **Approach**: Zero external dependencies, minimal dev overhead, immediate feedback

## Performance Budgets & Rationale

### Current Budgets
- **Raw Bundle Size**: 5.25 MB
- **Gzipped Bundle Size**: 1.38 MB

### Rationale
These budgets are set 4% above current measurements (~5.16MB raw, ~1.33MB gzipped) to:
1. **Allow for natural growth** from small features/fixes
2. **Prevent significant regressions** that impact user experience  
3. **Force conscious decisions** when adding large dependencies
4. **Maintain baseline performance** for target markets

The current app includes comprehensive functionality (job tracking, maps, PDF generation, Excel processing) which explains the substantial bundle size. Future optimization opportunities exist through code-splitting and selective imports.

## How It Works

### 1. Manifest-Based Analysis
- Vite generates `dist/.vite/manifest.json` with chunk metadata
- Script identifies entry points (`isEntry: true`)
- Recursively collects **eager imports only** (excludes dynamic imports)
- Calculates file sizes from actual `dist/` files

### 2. Eager vs Dynamic Import Distinction
```javascript
// INCLUDED in budget (eager):
import { Component } from './component'

// EXCLUDED from budget (dynamic):
const Component = await import('./component')
```

### 3. Gzip Calculation
Uses Node's built-in `zlib.gzipSync()` to match real-world compression, providing accurate size estimates for network transfer.

### 4. Threshold Validation
Compares both raw and gzipped sizes against budgets. Fails if **either** threshold is exceeded, ensuring comprehensive size control.

## CI Workflow Overview

### Triggers
- **Pull Requests**: to `main` or `develop` branches
- **Push Events**: to `perf/*`, `feat/*`, `fix/*` branches

### Steps
1. **Build**: `npm run build:ci` (produces manifest and assets)
2. **Check**: `npm run perf:check` (validates against budgets)
3. **Report**: Generates job summary with current vs. budget comparison
4. **Artifacts**: Uploads `perf-summary.json`, `manifest.json`, `stats.html`

### Failure Conditions
- Bundle size > 5.25 MB (raw)
- Bundle size > 1.38 MB (gzipped)
- Missing manifest or budget files
- Script execution errors

### Sample CI Output
```
üìä Found 1 entry point(s):
üîç Processing entry: index.html
  ‚úì assets/index-BJy-0U6G.js: 5.06 MB (1.32 MB gzipped)
  ‚úì assets/index-DRw0qhWD.css: 101.2 KB (16.04 KB gzipped)

üìà Initial Bundle Analysis:
Total Size: 5.16 MB
Gzipped Size: 1.33 MB
Budget: 5.25 MB (1.38 MB gzipped)

‚úÖ Performance Budget: PASSED
```

## Developer Guide

### Local Testing
```bash
# Standard workflow
npm run build:ci && npm run perf:check

# With visual analysis
npm run perf:analyze  # Creates dist/stats.html
```

### Understanding Results
The `dist/perf-summary.json` contains:
```json
{
  "initialBytes": 5412504,
  "initialGzipBytes": 1398527,
  "entries": [...],
  "timestamp": "2025-09-19T13:23:07.597Z",
  "thresholdBytes": 5500000,
  "thresholdGzipBytes": 1450000,
  "passed": true
}
```

### Adjusting Thresholds Responsibly

**Before increasing budgets:**
1. Run `npm run perf:analyze` to investigate growth
2. Check for new dependencies or inefficient imports
3. Consider code-splitting opportunities
4. Evaluate if the increase is justified

**When updating budgets:**
1. Edit `perf/performance-budget.json`
2. Document rationale in the `note` field
3. Consider user impact on slower connections
4. Test performance on target devices

**Example budget update:**
```json
{
  "initialBytes": 5800000,
  "initialGzipBytes": 1500000,
  "note": "Increased after adding Excel export feature (2025-09-19). Acceptable trade-off for core functionality."
}
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### File Structure
```
.github/workflows/perf-budget.yml  # CI workflow
scripts/check-initial-size.mjs     # Analysis script  
perf/performance-budget.json       # Budget configuration
docs/perf/README.md               # Developer guide
dist/perf-summary.json            # Generated report
dist/.vite/manifest.json          # Vite build manifest
```

### Dependencies
- **Zero runtime dependencies** added
- **Single dev dependency**: `rollup-plugin-visualizer` for bundle analysis
- **Node built-ins**: `fs`, `zlib`, `path` for file operations and compression

### Script Features
- Manifest parsing with recursive dependency traversal
- File size calculation from actual build artifacts
- Gzip compression using Node's native implementation
- JSON report generation with detailed breakdown
- Exit codes for CI integration (0 = pass, 1 = fail)

## Next Steps

### Immediate Opportunities
1. **Code Splitting**: Implement route-based dynamic imports
2. **Selective Imports**: Replace full library imports with specific exports
3. **Bundle Analysis**: Use generated `stats.html` to identify optimization targets

### Future Enhancements
1. **Per-Route Budgets**: Monitor individual page payloads
2. **Lighthouse CI**: Add runtime performance metrics
3. **Progressive Budgets**: Different limits based on connection type
4. **Regression Tracking**: Historical size trends and alerts

### Bundle Optimization Ideas
```javascript
// Instead of:
import * as XLSX from 'xlsx'

// Consider:
import { read, write } from 'xlsx/mini'

// Instead of:
import { format } from 'date-fns'

// Consider:
const { format } = await import('date-fns')
```

## Conclusion

This implementation provides:
- ‚úÖ **Zero-config CI enforcement** of bundle size budgets
- ‚úÖ **Detailed reporting** with gzipped size analysis  
- ‚úÖ **Developer-friendly** local testing and investigation tools
- ‚úÖ **Minimal dependencies** and maintenance overhead
- ‚úÖ **Immediate feedback** on performance regressions

The system strikes a balance between preventing regressions and allowing reasonable growth, with clear paths for optimization and threshold adjustments when justified by feature requirements.
